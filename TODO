Steps:
1. twitter:
   * login integration
   * collector manager
2. image processing:
   * make osaic.py a library: passing file or db-obj handles
     osaic.mosaicify(target_image=dbobj, source_images=[source_image db_objs (or SourcePosition objs)], class=MosaicRender, strategy=Strategy), zoom=1,
            Strategy(targetX,targetY,num_sources)
   * django update/creation command (using files)
     * cron job with a 'ready' flag might be enough here



Jobs/Threads:
 * Twitter API updates (streaming and/or REST)
 * downloading images
 * rendering mosaic + jsondata

Per project:
 Input:
  * hashtag/search
    * default filter:safe
  * mosaic target image
  * how many images to collect at minimum
  * target region (for later) (US/State/City)

 Processing/State
  * tweet list
  * earliest tweet/latest tweet (for max_id or since)
  * images
    * image count
  * last render
    * last render image count


Features (for future):
 * geo search/categorization
 * default target image is image of country or state?

Basic Interface:
 * show mosaic
 * overlay translucent version of image
 * on click, show tweet + user
 * maybe show stream of tweeters

  *can't connect to streaming endpoints

twitter python libraries (that having streaming)
seems to be the big one:

Nik:
For the MVP, I think the tool should be able to collect and download public profile photos from Twitter users who use a specific hashtag, and then upload them into a free mosaic creation tool like Mosaicly.

Eventually, the tool would be able to pull from Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, and Tumblr, as well as take direct submissions of photos, into our own mosaic creating back-end system in real time.

Then later down the line, the mosaic would be interactive (i.e. People could zoom in and search for themselves), embedable, have performance analytics and other bells and whistles that are yet to be determined.

Ultimately, it would be incredible to have a turn-key solution similar to Hyperactivate's product.

Not sure where this fits in the development, but it would ask be great to be able to integrate with something like CleanSpeak, a service which automatically flags and rejects content that has hate speech, porn, etc. Not exactly sure how it works.
